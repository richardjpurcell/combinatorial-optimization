grid size = 3 x 3
grid cell size = 1000m
time slot = 60 minutes
total time slots = 12
total drones = 1
max drone battery life = 6 time slots
drone speed = 1 grid cell / time slot
drone recharge time = 1 time slot

drone base station = upper left hand corner cell 
all drones begin from base station
drones return to base station to recharge
designate each cell in (x, y) form

If drone visits a cell during a time slot then visited = 1
If no drone visits a cell during a time slot then visited = 0
A drone travelling through a cell enroute to another cell counts as visited = 1
coverage score = sum of visited / time slot
total coverage = sum of coverage scores / total time slots

First solve TSP for each cell and store results.
Using TSP results use NSP to create possible schedules and store results.
Using KP and drone constraints (i.e. max drone battery) select best schedule from NSP results.

Details of each time slice:
-drone location, destination, battery life
-each cell's visited/no_visited score
-coverage score
